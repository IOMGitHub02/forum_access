forum_access HEAD:
  Bugs fixed:

    - Provide a message for uninitialized forums when newly installed, rather than the incorrect 'default' setting of grant_all for 1 & 2.
    - #222477: forum_access_node_access_records() didn't return its result.
  Porting to D6:
    - #231611: Add support for non-forum content types.
    - Avoid E_NOTICEs â€” ready for beta.
    - First-shot port to D6.
    - Copied 5.x-1.9.
