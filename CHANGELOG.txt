CHANGELOG for Forum Access for Drupal 6

forum_access HEAD:
  Bugs fixed:
    - Use node_access_needs_rebuild() rather than node_access_rebuild() when enabling/disabling module.
    - Fix cosmetic coder issues (no functional change).
    - #246959: Fix a bad t() call.
    - #219778: Remove grants when roles are deleted, purge orphaned grants.
    - #230123: Newest pgsql refuses to do automatic type conversions.
    - Provide a message for uninitialized forums when newly installed, rather than the incorrect 'default' setting of grant_all for 1 & 2.
    - #222477: forum_access_node_access_records() didn't return its result.
  Porting to D6:
    - #128846: Accommodate PostgreSQL 8.3's requirement for explicit casts.
    - Publish .pot file.
    - Port precautionary warning on Content Access page (will need to test and activate full diagnostics when CA is ported).
    - #231611: Add support for non-forum content types; update moderator(s) when changing forum.
    - Avoid E_NOTICEs â€” ready for beta.
    - First-shot port to D6.
    - Copied 5.x-1.9.
